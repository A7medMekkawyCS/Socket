# Socket.IO + Express + MongoDB Backend

A production-ready backend service that provides RESTful endpoints and real-time communication using WebSockets. It is designed for applications that need both traditional HTTP APIs and instant, bidirectional messaging between server and clients.

## What this service does
- Exposes a lightweight HTTP API for health checks and future business endpoints.
- Maintains a persistent connection with clients to send and receive events in real time.
- Connects to MongoDB to store and retrieve application data.
- Applies common web server middleware such as JSON parsing, request logging, and CORS handling.

## Key features
- Real-time messaging: clients can connect and exchange events instantly.
- REST API foundation: includes a starting point for conventional endpoints.
- Database integration: uses MongoDB through Mongoose for reliability and scalability.
- Configurable CORS to control which frontends are allowed to connect.
- Structured project layout to make it easy to extend with models, routes, and services.

## Technology stack
- Node.js and Express for the HTTP server and middleware.
- Socket.IO for WebSocket-based, real-time communication.
- MongoDB with Mongoose for data persistence and schema modeling.
- Environment-driven configuration to adapt across environments (development, staging, production).

## Architecture overview
- The HTTP server and Socket.IO share the same network port, simplifying deployment.
- Middleware handles cross-origin requests, JSON bodies, and request logging.
- A database connection is established on startup; the service exits early if the database is unreachable to avoid running in a broken state.
- The real-time layer listens for client connections and relays messages to connected peers when appropriate.

## Configuration
- Port: defines which port the server listens on.
- MongoDB connection: the database URI used to connect to a local or hosted MongoDB instance.
- CORS origins: a single origin or comma-separated list to restrict which frontends can access the API and socket connection.

## API overview
- Health check endpoint: returns the operational status and current server time. This is helpful for uptime monitoring and basic diagnostics.
- Example “hello” endpoint: returns a simple JSON message to confirm the server is reachable and responding. Additional business endpoints can be added following the same pattern.

## Real-time communication
- Clients connect to the server and receive a unique session identifier.
- Messages sent by a connected client can be broadcast to all other clients or routed according to future business rules.
- The connection lifecycle (connect and disconnect events) is logged to assist with debugging.
